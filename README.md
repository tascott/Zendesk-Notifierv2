Authentication flow:

- click extension icon
- enter your Zendesk domain
- click "Save Settings"

Redirects to a static github page

Note: this page needs the extension ID, TODO: this might be different for everyone so I need to make this dynamic

TODO:

- If ticket is under 30 seconds, play sound 1
- If new tickets but over 30s old, play sound 2
- When published, removed the KEY from the manifest.json, and update the oath redirect url to the new generated one
